# Helper that creates a JS timer and, when it's counted down, causes
# submission of the one and only form on this page

module TimerHelper
  # Produce a JavaScript timer that counts down from +seconds+ and submits the first (only)
  # form on the page when it expires.
  # The helper emits a +<span>+ with +id="_timer_"+;
  # its *presence on the page* causes a  
  # Timer to be started.  See +timer.js+ for the timer code.
  # Only one timer per view is allowed.
  #
  # ==== Options
  # * +:seconds+ - number of seconds to count down from.  If not given uses value of +@timer+ variable
  # * +:submit+ - a URL that will be fetched via GET (replacing the current page) when the timer expires.  If absent, the one and only form on the page will be submitted via POST.
